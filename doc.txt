Certainly, let's break down the classes without providing the full code. You can use these class descriptions as a guide to create your Java classes:

### `BankAccount` Class:
- **Attributes:**
  - `accountNumber` (String): Represents the unique identifier for the account.
  - `accountHolder` (String): Stores the name of the account holder.
  - `balance` (double): Holds the current balance of the account.
  - `transactionHistory` (List<Transaction>): A list to store the transaction history associated with the account.

- **Methods:**
  - `deposit(double amount)`: Accepts an amount and updates the account balance accordingly. It also records the transaction in the transaction history.
  - `withdraw(double amount)`: Accepts an amount and checks if there are sufficient funds before updating the account balance. Records the transaction in the transaction history.
  - `getBalance()`: Returns the current balance of the account.
  - `getTransactionHistory()`: Returns the list of transactions associated with the account.
  - `recordTransaction(String type, double amount)`: Records a transaction with the specified type (e.g., deposit, withdrawal) and amount.

### `Transaction` Class:
- **Attributes:**
  - `transactionType` (String): Indicates the type of transaction (e.g., deposit, withdrawal).
  - `amount` (double): Stores the amount involved in the transaction.
  - `timestamp` (long): Represents the timestamp of when the transaction occurred.

- **Methods:**
  - `getTransactionType()`: Returns the type of the transaction.
  - `getAmount()`: Returns the amount involved in the transaction.
  - `getTimestamp()`: Returns the timestamp of the transaction.

### `BankManagementSystem` Class:
- **Methods:**
  - `main(String[] args)`: The main entry point of the program. It creates instances of the `BankAccount` class and handles user input to perform operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and displaying account information.

These classes form the core structure of a simple bank management system. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to add more functionalities, error handling, and possibly integrate data persistence mechanisms such as a database.
